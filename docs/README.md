# Documentation

This directory contains documentation of all tasks and changes made to the CursorHKT project.

- What changes were made
- Why they were made
- How they were implemented
- Build results and verification

## File Naming Convention

- Use descriptive names: `YYYY-MM-DD-task-description.md`
- Or feature-based names: `feature-name-implementation.md`
- Examples:
  - `2024-01-15-add-user-authentication.md`
  - `navigation-system-refactor.md`
  - `ios-build-workflow-setup.md`
